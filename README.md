# Hello World Django App

This Django app demonstrates a simple "Hello World" application with two routes. One route returns a JSON message, and the other renders an HTML page.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Django 3.2 or higher

## Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   If you have this project in a GitHub repository, provide the command to clone it. If not, the user needs to download the project files to their local machine.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/SyedAbbuTurab/DjangoHelloWorldApp
   cd myproject
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

   On Windows:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS and Linux:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Install Django using pip. Ensure you are in the project directory where `requirements.txt` is located (if you have one).

   ```
   pip install django
   ```

4. **Migrate the Database**

   Set up the initial database tables.

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the Django development server.

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

## Accessing the Routes

Once the server is running, you can access the routes in a web browser or using a tool like `curl`.

- **JSON Response Route**

  To get the JSON response, visit `http://localhost:8000/helloworld/hello/`. This will return a JSON object with the message "Hello World!".

  ```json
  {"Message": "Hello World!"}
  ```

- **HTML Page Route**

  To view the HTML page, navigate to `http://localhost:8000/helloworld/hellohtml/`. This route renders an HTML page displaying "Hello World!" in bold.

## Project Structure

Briefly describe the key directories and files in your project, for example:

- `helloworld/`: The Django app containing the views and templates.
  - `templates/`: Contains the HTML templates for the app.
  - `views.py`: Defines the views for the JSON response and the HTML page.
- `myproject/`: The Django project directory.
  - `settings.py`: Project settings including the `INSTALLED_APPS` configuration.
- `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project.

## Additional Commands

- **Creating an Admin User**

  If your app uses Django's admin, include instructions for creating an admin user.

  ```
  python manage.py createsuperuser
  ```

- **Running Tests**

  Provide instructions for running tests if your app includes them.

  ```
  python manage.py test
  ```
